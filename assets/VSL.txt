If you feel like neuropathy
is holding you back
from truly enjoying your life,
then this 60 second video
will be the most important thing
you will see today.
A physiotherapist from Grande Prairie
has recently shared a strange trick
anyone can use to soothe
agonizing neuropathic foot pain.
And Medicares are now starting
to implement his work across
Canadian treatment centers.
David, a physiotherapist and dedicated son,
woke up to a big scare one morning.
His 80 year old mother, who was living with his family
due to her worsening neuropathy,
had a horrifying accident.
As he descended the stairs,
he found his elderly mother
lying face down at the bottom,
rushed to the hospital.
The doctor revealed a fracture from the fall.
Even though she was okay,
The doctor said it could have been much worse
and even resulted in death.
However, the nerve conductivity test
uncovered a shocking discovery.
Dorothy's peripheral nerves
were rapidly deteriorating
and she was losing control
of the muscles in her feet,
causing the fall.
The doctor warned that without intervention,
she was on the path to a wheelchair.
Determined, David vowed
to help his mother reclaim the independence
her neuropathy had stolen
and prevent such incidents from happening again.
As a physiotherapist,
David knew the gabapentin his mother was taking
was just a bandage solution.
It provides a temporary fix
but does nothing to fix
the eroding nerves starved of blood flow.
So instead, David decided to try
something completely different.
Using his expertise in physiotherapy,
David studied common neuropathy therapies
and discovered one
crucial element they were all missing.
Massage therapy and physiotherapy
only provide relief from neuropathy
for a few short days.
Then the tingling, burning and
stabbing pains return.
David knew from his understanding
of the human body
that this is because
these two therapies increase
blood circulation around the feet,
which means more oxygen and nutrients
reach the peripheral nerves,
allowing them to repair and regenerate.
However, a few days after the therapy,
blood circulation levels drop,
resulting in the agonizing pain
flooding the feet again
as the nerves are starved
of the oxygen and nutrients
they depend on.
Taking this into account,
David knew
he had to increase
not temporarily,
but constantly,
all day, every day.
So he crafted his own compression socks
that his mother could use
to skyrocket blood flow
around her feet for as long as she needed.
David decided to put his creation to the test,
and his mother couldn't believe what happened.
After just 15 minutes, the numbness was replaced with
a warm comfort as the sensation
she had lost returned to her feet.
Then later that day, she wore them to bed,
falling asleep straight away without her
burning, stabbing pains flaring up.
Her pain was soothed
as a constant supply of
oxygen and nutrients
started flowing throughout her feet,
fueling the nerve regeneration process
and successfully alleviating
the neuropathic pain in his mother's feet.the neuropathic pain in his mother's feet.
David crafted them using the latest crosswoven
medical grade compression fabric
that has a unique shape where property
this means it molds to
the slightest contours of the feet.
Under controlled testing at the
Grande Prairie Regional Hospital,
David's new form of compression
was able to soothe
the tingling, burning and stabbing pains
of 296 of the 300 patients
in 14 days or less.
That's when David realized
how big of an impact his new solution could have.
He applied for and won a government grant
at the Business Chamber Grande Prairie
his local chamber of Commerce.
This allowed him to work with
Functional Aid,
a Canadian medical startup,
and with the help of neuropathy experts
and product developers, they finalized the design
and brought the solution to market.
Eliminates Foot Pain Reduces Swelling Fits Seamlessly Into Podiatrist Approved Everyday Life
the latest innovation in compression therapy
that eliminates tingling, burning and stabbing
neuropathic foot pain
in just 14 days or less.
The secret to Functional Socks success is
the compression zone technology they use
by using five different compression zones.
Each zone applies the perfect amount
of pressure to the network of blood vessels
that lie beneath it.
Skyrocketing blood flow
throughout the feet all day long
so that starved nerves are able to repair
and regenerate as they are nourished
with the oxygen and nutrients they depend on.
The best part.
All you have to do is slip them on
in the morning
or before going to bed.
And then the compression zone technology
will do all the work for you,
delivering a constant flow of oxygen
and nutrient rich blood as you go about your day.
Functional Socks are simply unmatched by
any ordinary compression socks
in every category,
as they are clinically proven to
enhance blood flow three times
more effectively than ordinary solutions.
Simply put them on
when your feet are most painful,
whether it's first thing in the morning
or before going to bed,
then go about your normal day.
As you notice, your feet aren't bothered
by the tingling, burning or stabbing pains
that usually trouble your feet.
Over the next 14 days, you notice the pain
slowly fading from your feet
as the pain is drained and swapped
for a newfound sense of comfort.
They will eliminate your pain in just
14 days or less.
It's why people across Canada
are choosing Functional Socks
over the fleeting band-aid relief of prescription drugs.
It's no secret that these medications
only cover up the pain
and don't do anything
to help the nerves regenerate.
Wouldn't you like to finally help
repair your starved nerve fibers
and stop neuropathy from forcing you
to become dependent on crutches or a wheelchair?
As the progressive disease

David wants everyone to know
